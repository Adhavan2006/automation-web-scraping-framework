This project demonstrates my understanding of automation workflows, test reliability, and data validation, aligning with QA and automation testing responsibilities.

This project is a Selenium-based automation framework built using Python to extract and validate data from dynamic web applications such as Myntra, Flipkart, and Zomato. The framework automates browser interactions, handles infinite scrolling, dynamically loaded elements, and common exceptions like timeouts and missing elements.

The extracted data (product names, prices, ratings, restaurant details, etc.) is stored in CSV and JSON formats for further analysis and verification. The project focuses on reliability, reusability, and clean code structure, making it suitable for automation testing and quality assurance workflows.
